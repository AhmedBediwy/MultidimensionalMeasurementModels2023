TITLE: CFA with 2D exploratory (lower echelon) Q-matrix

DATA: 
    FILE = cfaData.dat;

VARIABLE:
    NAMES = y1-y10;

ANALYSIS:
    TYPE = GENERAL;
    ESTIMATOR = MLR;

OUTPUT:
    STDYX;
    RESIDUAL;

MODEL:

    ! measurement model specification:
    theta1 by y1* y2-y10; ! * override mplus' default of first item being marker for variance
    theta2 by y2* y3-y10; 

    ! structural model specification:
    [theta1@0]; ! fix the mean of theta1 to zero
    [theta2@0]; ! fix the mean of theta2 to zero

    theta1@1; !fix variance of theta1 
    theta2@1; !fix variance of theta2 

    theta1 with theta2 @0; !fix covariance of theta1 and theta2 to zero
