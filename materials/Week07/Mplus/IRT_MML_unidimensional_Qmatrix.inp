    CATEGORICAL = y1-y10;

ANALYSIS:
    TYPE = GENERAL;
    ESTIMATOR = MLR;
    ALGORITHM = INTEGRATION;

MODEL:

    ! measurement model specification:
    theta1 by y1* y2-y10; ! * override mplus' default of first item being marker for variance

    ! structural model specification:
    [theta1@0]; ! fix the mean of theta1 to zero
    theta1@1; !fix variance of theta1
